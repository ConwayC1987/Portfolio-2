The Guess Who Pub Quiz Game is a knowledge based quiz game that gives the users two choices and a question. The user has the option to read the rules of the game to better understand the game. The user is given an opportunity to play the quiz against a clock to select the correct answer providing the user with two images with the name of the person.

The idea was to keep the questions simple with only two options for the answers to give an element of chance to the game and make the game more fun for the user. The game could be marketed for the pub industry for a quiz night with prizes for the customers to bring in more business on quiet nights.

# UX Design

For `Project-2` it was decided to create a quiz game that I would like to play myself. I also wanted to design something the could be marketed to a user (Pub owners) so I decided to make a simple and fun pub quiz game that rewards the user. Rather than just making a normal quiz site I wanted to add some extra aspects that I felt would make the quiz more fun and appealing to the users. I decided that because it was a pub quiz the questions would have to be simple questions for the user as alcohol might of been consumed.

For the website design I felt like I could manipulate the DOM to create a single page quiz game app which is what I have done. From using display properties effectively I was able to reduce a three page site down to one and create a better user experience.

           <summary>The Game</summary>
           <p>It was decided that I would use two options for the answers giving the user a 50/50 chance of getting it right making it more fun. 65% of people's brain work visually meaning they find it easier seeing images so it was decided that each question how have an image associated with it. The questions I decided to select involve sports, Irish politics and famous celebrities actors. I also wanted to add a countdown timer to create urgency also a way for the user to know how many questions left and how many they got correct. It was decided early that it was important to make the quiz suitable that it would fit on a phone screen without the need to have to scroll down to read a question in the quiz.</p>
           <summary>Font style</summary>
           <p>The font style that I decided to use was from google fonts Oswald and sans-serif were used.</p>
           <summary>Colors Used</summary>
           <p>The color scheme I decided on was a dark background color a light shaded black and a bright vibrant blue color to stand out. As this is a single page game the background is constant for the entire website including for pop up modals.</p>
           <summary>Images</summary>
           <p>The images on this site are used were all made to be the same size and were got from Wikipedia.</p>

           ![Website Rules pop out](/readMe_images/modalRules.jpg "The quiz rules")
           <p>The modal idea was taken from w3schools and changed to suit the website. The rules were kept short and simple because it is a pub quiz.</p>    
           <summary>The image used</summary>
           <p>The image used for the rules page is meant to funny it is men on strike because of prohibition. This is an attempt to introduce some fun to the experience.</p>

           ![Website game area](/readMe_images/gameArea.jpg "The game area")

           ![Website game top area](/readMe_images/gameTop.jpg "The game area with timer")
           <p>The user is given a clock that gives the user 10 seconds to answer, when the time gets to 7 seconds the clock starts to flash red warning the user. When the 10 seconds runs out the next question will appear and the question will be marked incorrect. If the used clicks an answer then the clock will reset. The idea for the time gauge and progress circles part of the website was taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pYIMygIcU and changed to suit the project.</p>
         </details>

The results modal: <details>
           <summary>Results Modal</summary>
           ![Website results area](/readMe_images/modalResults.jpg "The game result modal")
           <p>The results modal is in the same design of the rules modal and the idea was taken from w3schools.</p>    
         </details>

The footer: <details>
           <summary>Footer</summary>
           ![Website results area](/readMe_images/footer.jpg "The game result modal")
           <p>The footer is a simple design and centered on the screen. I choose a github icon from https://www.w3schools.com/icons/tryit.asp?filename=tryicons_fa-github. The icon is a link to my github repositories for any user that might be interested in future projects. The github icon is designed to hide itself when the game starts, this was done because in testing the game on a phone I found the icon can be clicked by accident also to improve user experience.</p>    
         </details>

The error 404 page: <details>
           <summary>404 Page</summary>
           ![The error 404 page](/readMe_images/404readME.png "The website 404 page")
           <p>The 404 page was put in as an extra feature, the idea is to keep the user on the website rather than having to click back. This was done to improve the user experience and make the website look more professional.</p>

## Responsiveness

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 320px and above by using dev tools. This included opening the site in browser right clicking and selecting inspect. The screen was then dragged in and out to ensure reponsiveness was to 320px. All pages were fully responsive when tested and passed.

 - git push - This command was used to push all committed code to github.

## Deployment to Github Pages

The steps to deploy are as follows:
