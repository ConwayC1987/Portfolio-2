The Guess Who Pub Quiz Game is a knowledge based quiz game that gives the users two choices and a question. The user has the option to read the rules of the game to better understand the game. The user is given an opportunity to play the quiz against a clock to select the correct answer providing the user with two images with the name of the person.

# UX Design

For `Project-2` it was decided to create a quiz game that I would like to play myself. I also wanted to design something the could be marketed to a user (Pub owners) so I decided to make a simple and fun pub quiz game that rewards the user. Rather than just making a normal quiz site I wanted to add some extra aspects that I felt would make the quiz more fun and appealing to the users. I decided that because it was a pub quiz the questions would have to be simple questions for the user as alcohol might of been consumed. 

Game Design : <details>
           <summary>The Game</summary>
           <p>It was decided that I would use two options for the answers giving the user a 50/50 chance of getting it right making it more fun. 65% of people's brain work visually meaning they find it easier seeing images so it was decided that each question how have an image associated with it. The questions I decided to select involve sports, Irish politics and famous celebrities actors. I also wanted to add a countdown timer to create urgency also a way for the user to know how many questions left and how many they got correct.</p>
           <p>The font style that I decided to use was from google fonts Oswald and sans-serif were used.</p>
           <summary>Colors Used</summary>
           <p>The color scheme I decided on was a dark background color a light shaded black and a bright vibrant blue color to stand out. As this is a single page game the background is constant for the entire website including for pop up modals.</p>
           <summary>Images</summary>
           <p>The images on this site are used were all made to be the same size and were got from Wikipedia.</p>
